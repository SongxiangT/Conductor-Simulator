![Conductor Simulator Icon](./path-to-your-icon.png) 

A Python-based conductor simulator that uses hand gestures to control music playback tempo and volume. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning, this tool offers an interactive experience for users to conduct music in real-time.

## 🎶 Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes MediaPipe for detecting and interpreting hand gestures.
- **Tempo Control:** Adjusts music playback speed based on user's wrist movements.
- **Volume Control:** Modulates the volume using hand extensivity.
- **Cue Detection:** Supports 'Pause' and 'Continue' gestures to control music playback.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Implements Kalman Filters for stabilizing gesture data.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your system.
- **VLC Media Player:** Ensure VLC is installed as it's used for audio playback.
